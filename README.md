# Everblox

Base theme & modular building blocks for WordPress created by Evermade.

## Development

### Getting started

Run `npm install` & `npm run dev`.

### Linting

JavaScript Linting has been moved from the dev task to Git pre-push. In practice this means that you won't be able to push your changes to the project repository until lint errors have been fixed.

To fix lint errors automatically, run `npm run lintfix` before pushing. Although not recommended, you can also skip the hook by running `git push --no-verify`.

## Design

The admin area uses custom images in some of the ACF fields. You can find the PSD files of these images on our Google Drive, from Team Drives > Evermade > Design > Everblox > Admin Assets.
